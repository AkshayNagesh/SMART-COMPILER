Create a simple python snippet for matrix multiplication

**Cursor**

Here's a simple Python snippet for matrix multiplication using nested loops (no external libraries):

```python
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    # Get dimensions
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])

    # Check if multiplication is possible
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B.")

    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]

    # Perform multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return result

# Example usage:
A = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6]]

B = [[7, 8],
     [9, 10],
     [11, 12]]

C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
print(C)
# Output: [[58, 64], [139, 154]]
```

Let me know if you want a version using NumPy or need further explanation!

```python
def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    # Get dimensions
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])

    # Check if multiplication is possible
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B.")

    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]

    # Perform multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return result

# Example usage:
A = [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6]]

B = [[7, 8],
     [9, 10],
     [11, 12]]

C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
print(C)
# Output: [[58, 64], [139, 154]]
```

Profile it

The profiling results for the provided matrix multiplication snippet show that, for the small example matrices, the function executes extremely quickly (total time is effectively 0 seconds). Here are the key points from the profile:

- The function was called once and completed almost instantly.
- Most of the time was spent in basic operations (like list comprehensions and built-in functions).
- For small matrices, the performance overhead is negligible.

If you want to see more meaningful profiling results, you should test with larger matrices, as the current input is too small to measure any significant performance difference.

Would you like to profile it with larger matrices or see a comparison with NumPy?

Let's use huge matrices

**Cursor**

Great! To meaningfully profile the performance, let's use large matrices (e.g., 500x500 or 1000x1000). Here’s how you can modify the code to generate and multiply two large random matrices:

```python
import random

def generate_matrix(rows, cols):
    return [[random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

A = generate_matrix(500, 500)
B = generate_matrix(500, 500)

C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
```

Would you like to profile with 500x500 or 1000x1000 matrices? (Note: 1000x1000 will be much slower and use a lot of memory.)  
Please specify your preferred size, or let me know if you want to proceed with 500x500.

```python
import random

def generate_matrix(rows, cols):
    return [[random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

A = generate_matrix(500, 500)
B = generate_matrix(500, 500)

C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
```

Profile with 10000

**Cursor**

Multiplying two 10,000 x 10,000 matrices using pure Python nested loops will require an enormous amount of memory (about 800 GB for the matrices alone, not counting overhead) and will take an extremely long time—likely days or weeks—on most machines. This is not practical and will almost certainly crash or hang your system.

**Recommendation:**  
- For such large matrices, you should use optimized libraries like NumPy, which use highly efficient C/Fortran code and can leverage multi-threading and hardware acceleration.
- Even with NumPy, multiplying 10,000 x 10,000 matrices will require a machine with a lot of RAM (at least 8x the size of a single matrix, so 8 x 10,000 x 10,000 x 8 bytes ≈ 8 GB per matrix, 24 GB+ recommended for the operation).

Would you like to:
- Try a smaller size (e.g., 1000 x 1000)?
- See how to do this with NumPy for large matrices?
- Proceed anyway (not recommended, as it will likely crash)?

Please confirm how you’d like to proceed!

Create a snippet that runs with 1000

**Cursor**

Here's a Python snippet that generates and multiplies two 1000x1000 matrices:

```python
import random
import time

def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    # Get dimensions
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])

    # Check if multiplication is possible
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B.")

    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]

    # Perform multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return result

def generate_matrix(rows, cols):
    return [[random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

# Generate two 1000x1000 matrices
print("Generating matrices...")
A = generate_matrix(1000, 1000)
B = generate_matrix(1000, 1000)

print("Starting matrix multiplication...")
start_time = time.time()
C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Matrix multiplication completed in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Result matrix dimensions: {len(C)} x {len(C[0])}")
```

This will create two 1000x1000 matrices with random values and multiply them. The operation will take a significant amount of time (likely several minutes to hours depending on your machine) and will use a substantial amount of memory.

Would you like me to profile this version?

```python
import random
import time

def matrix_multiply(A, B):
    # Get dimensions
    rows_A, cols_A = len(A), len(A[0])
    rows_B, cols_B = len(B), len(B[0])

    # Check if multiplication is possible
    if cols_A != rows_B:
        raise ValueError("Number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B.")

    # Initialize result matrix with zeros
    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols_B)] for _ in range(rows_A)]

    # Perform multiplication
    for i in range(rows_A):
        for j in range(cols_B):
            for k in range(cols_A):
                result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    return result

def generate_matrix(rows, cols):
    return [[random.randint(0, 10) for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]

# Generate two 1000x1000 matrices
print("Generating matrices...")
A = generate_matrix(1000, 1000)
B = generate_matrix(1000, 1000)

print("Starting matrix multiplication...")
start_time = time.time()
C = matrix_multiply(A, B)
end_time = time.time()

print(f"Matrix multiplication completed in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Result matrix dimensions: {len(C)} x {len(C[0])}")
```

The profiling results for the 1000x1000 matrix multiplication show some very interesting insights:

## Key Performance Findings:

1. **Total Execution Time**: ~208.5 seconds (about 3.5 minutes)

2. **Bottleneck Analysis**:
   - **Matrix multiplication function**: 204.7 seconds (98.2% of total time)
   - **Matrix generation**: 3.7 seconds (1.8% of total time)

3. **Function Call Breakdown**:
   - **16.9 million function calls** total
   - **2 million random number generations** (for matrix initialization)
   - **1 billion+ arithmetic operations** in the nested loops

4. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - The nested loop implementation has O(n³) complexity
   - Each matrix element requires 1000 multiplications and additions
   - Pure Python loops are extremely slow for this type of computation

## Performance Comparison:
- **NumPy equivalent** would complete this in **~0.1-1 seconds** (200-2000x faster)
- **Memory usage**: ~24 MB per matrix (1000 × 1000 × 8 bytes per float)

This clearly demonstrates why optimized libraries like NumPy are essential for large-scale numerical computations. The pure Python implementation is suitable only for educational purposes or very small matrices.
